Skunk Rules:

DIRECTIONS FOR PLAYING

The object of the game is to hold the most chips after 5 rounds of play.

In a round of play, each player takes turns rolling the dice.  A score is made by combining the points on the two dice. 
For example: A 4 and 5 would be 9 points.  
The player has the privilege of continuing to shake to increase their round score, or they may pass the dice to the next player. 

PENALTIES:
A skunk rolled voids the score for that turn.  The player must place 1 chip in the "kitty", and pass the dice to the next player.
A deuce / double skunk voids the score for the turn AND the round up to that point.  The player must place 2 chips in the "kitty", and pass the dice to the next player.


Once a player has reached 100+ pounds for the round, they may choose to keep rolling, or pass the dice.  Once the player finishes their turn, their round score becomes the goal for
other players to reach.  Each other player has one turn left to surpass this goal.  The round ends when everyone has rolled, and the winner of the round collects all chips in the "kitty" and in addition five chips from each losing player or 
10 chips from any player without a score.

The winner of the game is the person with the most chips after 5 rounds.

Any number of people can play. [Assume at least two players!] The suggested number of chips to start is 50.
